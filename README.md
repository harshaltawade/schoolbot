# Problem Statement :

 In todays world as there are everything is digital. 
 In education system work is very lengthy and time consuming and also required extra manpower. 
 I am developing this chatbot for school,parents and students.The parents does not have to go personally to school for enquiry. 
 The chatbot enables parents to be updated with school. This System is a chatbot which provides answer to the query of the student. 
 Students just have to query through the bot which is used for chating. Students can chat using any format there is no specific format the user has to follow. 
 The System uses built in artificial intelligence to answer the query. 
 The answers are appropriate what the user queries. The User can query any college related activities through the system.
 The user does not have to personally go to the college for enquiry.
 The System analyses the question and than answers to the user.
